This repository gathers all the projects done for the Core Curriculum at 42 Wolfsburg.

## Projects

### 1. LIBFT
- **Description**: Recreation of key functions from the C standard library (`<string.h>`, `<stdlib.h>`, `<ctype.h>`, etc.).
- **Skills Developed**: Deep understanding of memory management, string manipulation, and data structures in C.

### 2. get_next_line
- **Description**: A function that reads a line from a file descriptor until reaching a newline or the end of the file.
- **Skills Developed**: File handling, buffer management, and dynamic memory allocation.

### 3. ft_printf
- **Description**: Custom implementation of the C `printf` function, handling multiple conversion specifiers like `%d`, `%s`, `%x`, etc.
- **Skills Developed**: Variadic functions, formatting, and output stream management.

### 4. pipex
- **Description**: A program that simulates the Unix shell `pipe` functionality, connecting multiple command outputs to inputs using pipes.
- **Skills Developed**: Process management, piping, redirection, and working with multiple file descriptors.

### 5. Born2BeRoot
- **Description**: Linux server configuration project where a virtual machine is configured with essential security features.
- **Skills Developed**: System administration, setting up firewalls, SSH, UFW, and managing users and permissions.

### 6. push_swap
- **Description**: Sorting data on a stack using a set of predefined operations and writing an algorithm to do it in as few moves as possible.
- **Skills Developed**: Algorithm optimization, stack manipulation, and complexity analysis.

### 7. so_long
- **Description**: A 2D game in which the player moves through a tile-based map, collects items, and reaches an exit.
- **Skills Developed**: Game development, event handling, 2D rendering, and basic AI.

### 8. minishell
- **Description**: Creation of a simple Unix shell supporting execution of commands, pipes, redirection, and environment variables.
- **Skills Developed**: Parsing, process control, signal handling, and job management.

### 9. philosophers
- **Description**: Implementation of the classical "Dining Philosophers" problem to explore concurrency and avoid deadlock.
- **Skills Developed**: Multi-threading, mutexes, and avoiding race conditions and deadlocks.

### 10. cub3d
- **Description**: A 3D game engine using raycasting (inspired by Wolfenstein 3D), where the player navigates through a maze-like environment.
- **Skills Developed**: 3D rendering, raycasting, graphics programming with the MiniLibX library.

### 11. NetPractice
- **Description**: Networking project to troubleshoot and configure virtual networks, subnets, and routing.
- **Skills Developed**: IP addressing, subnetting, routing, and understanding network layers.

### 12. CPP Module (00 - 09)
- **Description**: A series of projects designed to introduce the basics of C++ including object-oriented programming, memory management, and templates.
- **Skills Developed**: Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, and advanced memory handling techniques like smart pointers.

### 13. IRC
- **Description**: Implementation of an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) server, where multiple clients can connect and communicate.
- **Skills Developed**: Socket programming, network protocols, and multi-client server handling.

### 14. ft_transcendence
- **Description**: A full-stack web project combining front-end and back-end technologies to build a real-time multiplayer Pong game with authentication, database management, and live communication features.
- **Skills Developed**: Full-stack development, WebSockets, real-time communication, and database management.

---

Each project helped to develop a strong foundation in C, C++, system programming, and network communication, as well as a deeper understanding of algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving.

> **Note**: You may notice that there are not many pushes or commits in this repository. This is because many of the projects were originally completed within the schoolâ€™s internal system (Vogsphere) or on my previous setup. As a result, the number of commits here does not accurately reflect the actual work and progress made during each project.
